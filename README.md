# Stroke prediction

Stroke prediction is a project implemented as the university project for "Machine Learning" course. 
This project is a machine learning model for predicting strokes. 
It uses ensemble models to make predictions and is implemented in Python. 

## Installing / Getting started

1. Position in the root folder and run the following command in your terminal to install the required packages
   
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal

```shell
python main.py
```

## Data

The data used in this project is a healthcare dataset for stroke prediction. 
It includes various features such as gender, age, heart disease, work type, bmi and other.
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset).

The data analysis for this project is conducted in a Jupyter notebook: [data_analysis.ipynb](./data_analysis.ipynb).
This notebook contains exploratory data analysis and visualizations to understand 
the data better.

## Model

The model is implemented in the [main.py](./main.py) file. In this file, you can find the code for loading the data,
preprocessing it, training the model and evaluating its performance.

Many different models have been used in this project, but the best performing model is the Voting Classifier with Random Forest classifier.

## Results

Results are saved in the [results](./results) folder. The results include the classification report for best performing classifier and feature importance 
of the Random Forest model with AdaBoost classifier.
